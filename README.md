# Airport Management System

## Overview
The Airport Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline flight and passenger management operations at an airport. It offers a user-friendly interface to facilitate tasks such as adding, deleting, and viewing flights and passengers, along with implementing task scheduling algorithms for efficient flight scheduling.

## Features
- **Flight Management**: Add, delete, and view flight details including flight number, arrival time, and burst time.
- **Passenger Management**: Add, delete, and view passenger details associated with flights.
- **Task Scheduling Algorithms**: Implements task scheduling algorithms to efficiently schedule flights based on arrival and burst times.
- **GUI Interface**: Provides a graphical user interface built using Tkinter for easy interaction and navigation.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Utilizes SQLite database to store flight and passenger information, ensuring data integrity and persistence.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/airport-management-system.git
```

2. **Setup Database**: Run the `setup_database()` function to initialize the SQLite database.

```python
python app.py
```

3. **Run Application**: Execute the main script to launch the Airport Management System.

```python
python app.py
```

4. **Interact with GUI**: Use the graphical interface to add, delete, view flights and passengers, and schedule flights efficiently.
